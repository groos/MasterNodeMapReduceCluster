Korean barbecue has never been for the faint of stomach, but, consumed to the beat of “Gangnam Style,” amidst baseball-capped servers speed-walking in matching tees, it becomes a marathon for which untrained appetites may be at a distinct disadvantage. One might, for example, overdose on the palate-cleansing banchan (gratis side dishes consisting of lime-and-beet-juice-pickled daikon, honey-sweetened potato wedges, and silken tofu steeped in soy and chili), wholly ignorant of the appetizers to follow. These could include a hearty seafood pancake (a smidge too spongy for Paleo dieters, one suspects) and a beef tartare tossed with cubes of ripe Asian pear and generously drizzled with sesame oil (an unexpectedly refreshing pairing). The main event—there are only two options, grilled pork or beef—requires a hanging tubular smoke vacuum that evokes the tentacular appendage of a formidable space machine. Underneath it, in the center of the table, is the grill, ringed by a bright-yellow moat, half corn and mozzarella, half whisked egg batter, which will bubble into a creamy soufflé alongside the meat.
