Against this backdrop, Oracle glows, its bluish lights offering a vague aura in early-evening fog. This was, ostensibly, an ordinary regular-season game, but it felt like a celebration, because every night at Oracle since last fall has felt like a celebration. It was the sixty-fourth game of the year, and the Warriors had lost a total of six times. They had won twenty-six straight on this court. They not only had the best record in the N.B.A., people had been talking, for a while, about the possibility that they would surpass the seventy-two wins of Michael Jordanâ€™s Chicago Bulls, in 1996, and become, by general decree, the best team in league history.
